# Inserting a Multi-Dimensional Array in Java
A program coded in Java which finds the total number of even and odd numbers in an input array. 

Below are a few points that explain the use of the various elements in the upcoming code:

- Row integer number is considered as the number of Test-Cases and Column values are considered as values in each Test-Case.
- One for() loop is used for updating Test-Case number and another for() loop is used for taking respective array values.
- As all input entry is done, again two for() loops are used in the same manner to execute the program according to the condition specified.
- The first line of input is the total number of TestCases.
- The second line shows the total number of first array values.
- The third line gives array values and so on.
